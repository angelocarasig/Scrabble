## How to compile and run code
    - For testing purposes in the Player.cpp file under the replace tile function on line 102, the random time seed is set to 69,to run it normally change the parameter within the `srand()` function to `time(NULL)`.

    - To compile the code, enter the following command into the terminal: `g++ -Wall -Werror -std=c++14 -O -o scrabble scrabble.cpp Tile.cpp Node.cpp LinkedList.cpp TileBag.cpp Player.cpp Board.cpp Game.cpp`.

    - To run the code, enter the following command into the terminal: `./scrabble`

## How to run the Test Cases
    - end_mid_game
        - In this test the game terminates midgame because the code reaches the end of file.
        - To run the code, input the following command into the terminal: `./scrabble < TestCases/end_mid_game.input > TestCases/end_mid_game.gameout`
        - To compare the outputs, input the following command into the terminal: `diff -w TestCases/end_mid_game.output TestCases/end_mid_game.gameout`

    - save_test
        - In this test, the game save is being tested.
        - To run the code, input the following command into the terminal: `./scrabble < TestCases/save_test.input > TestCases/save_test.gameout`
        - To compare the outputs of the save file, input the following command into the terminal: `diff -w TestCases/save_test.expsave TestCases/save_test.save`

    - win_from_empty_hand
        - In this test, the game ends from a player placing all tiles from their hand and the tile bag is empty.
        - To run the code, input the following command into the terminal: `./scrabble < TestCases/win_from_empty_hand.input > TestCases/win_from_empty_hand.gameout`
        - To compare the outputs, input the following command into the terminal: `diff -w TestCases/win_from_empty_hand.output TestCases/win_from_empty_hand.gameout`

    - win_from_pass
        - In this test, the game ends from a player passing twice and the tile bag is empty.
        - To run the code, input the following command into the terminal: `./scrabble < TestCases/win_from_pass.input > TestCases/win_from_pass.gameout`
        - To compare the outputs, input the following command into the terminal: `diff -w TestCases/win_from_pass.output TestCases/win_from_pass.gameout`
